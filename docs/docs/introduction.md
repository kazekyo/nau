# Introduction

Nau is a library that makes it easy and convenient for [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) users to use a backend that follows [Relay GraphQL Server Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification).

- It makes cache operations such as adding items and pagination very easy.
- You can use directives to write declaratively and reduce bugs.
- Support co-location of components and fragments by allowing a query splitting into the fragments.
- Support subscriptions.

Nau aims to help users write frontend applications more quickly, with fewer bugs, and more efficiently.

Nau is inspired by [Relay](https://relay.dev/) and we have reproduced some features of Relay. However, our goal is not to create a full copy of Relay on Apollo Client. The goal is to make Apollo Client more powerful by integrating Relay GraphQL Server Specification.
