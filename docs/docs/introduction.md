# Introduction

Nau is a tool that makes the use of [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) more productive for users using [Relay GraphQL Server Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification) compliant backends.

- It makes cache operations such as adding items and pagination very easy.
- You can use custom directives to write declaratively and improve productivity.
- Support co-location of components and fragments by allowing a query to split into the fragments.
- Support subscriptions.

The tool aims to help frontend developers build frontend applications more quickly, with fewer bugs, and more efficiently.

Nau is inspired by [Relay](https://relay.dev/) and we have reproduced some features of Relay. However, our goal is not to create a full copy of Relay on Apollo Client. The goal is to make Apollo Client more powerful by integrating Relay GraphQL Server Specification.
