Nau
</h1>

Nau is a tool that makes [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client) more productive for users using [Relay GraphQL Server Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification) compliant backends.

- Make cache operations very easy
- Provide custom directives to write declaratively and improve productivity
- Support co-location of components and fragments by allowing a query to split into the fragments
- Support subscriptions

The tool aims to help frontend developers build frontend applications more quickly, with fewer bugs, and more efficiently.

Nau is a perfect fit with React, Apollo Client, GraphQL Code Generator, and TypeScript.
